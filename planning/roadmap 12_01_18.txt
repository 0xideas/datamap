0. Find documentation on IID formats in relevant countries and construct regular expressions to match them, and as narrowly as possible
1. write a comprehensive extract_text function that takes in a path and returns a string for a wide range of document types
2 create CLI or visual interface
3. build a corpus to train a fasttext classifier to classify paragraph topic
4. train fasttext classifier on corpus and include fasttext topic classification in the output for each paragraph
5. build a corpus of documents for sensitivity detection
6. apply our program to find iids and classify topics for individual paragraphs
7. read in program output and featurise, e.g. the number of iids found in each paragraph. Write these to new table
8. train machine learning algorithms on that dataset and compare. Pick the best one
9. include sensitivity detection in the main program

10. Find ways to automate steps 4. to 9. to adapt the program to different applications as needed.
